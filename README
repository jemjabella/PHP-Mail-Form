INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
To get started with the script, open mail_form_v2.txt in
your favourite plain text editor - this might be something like
Microsoft Notepad, or Mac TextEdit. Do not open the file in Microsoft
Word or programs of that sort, because it will mess up the special
characters.

When you've opened the file, customise the options at the top of the file
E.g. to set the email address you'd like to receive email at, change
$yourEmail = ""; to $yourEmail = "your_email@yourwebsite.com";
replacing your_email@yourwebsite.com with your email address.

When you've finished customising the options, save the file as "contact.php"
or a similar file name - it MUST have the .php extension to work

Having Trouble Renaming the File?
If you use Microsoft Windows and don’t have common file extensions shown,
when you rename the file, it may end up e.g. contact.php.txt.
To get around this, you can open the file in Notepad, go to Save As… and
enter the File name as "contact.php" (with the quotation marks).
This overrides the default file extension.

When you've renamed the file, upload it to your web server/host and use
it like any normal file.
